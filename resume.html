<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>I have a lot of experience with several of the most widely used industry frameworks and technologies, including <em>Python</em>, <em>React</em>, <em>Svelte</em>, and the majority of <em>HTML</em>/<em>CSS</em> pre- and post-processors. I have a strong love for writing clear, readable, and maintainable code, and I work hard to raise my own coding standards and impart my knowledge to others.</p>
<br>
<p>My friends frequently tell me that I am easy to speak with and a quick learner. This, I believe, is due in part to my readiness to ask questions and accept comments. They also see me as a resource for CSS and Python skills because I am virtually always willing to assist with coding projects.</p>
